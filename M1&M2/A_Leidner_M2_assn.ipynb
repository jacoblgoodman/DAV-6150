Your EDA writeup should include any insights you are able to derive from your statistical analysis of the attributes and the accompanying exploratory graphics you create (e.g., bar plots, box plots, histograms, line plots, etc.). You should also try to identify some preliminary predictive inferences, e.g., do any of the explanatory variables appear to be relatively more “predictive” of the response variable? There are a variety of ways you can potentially identify such relationships between the explanatory variables and the response variable. It is up to you as the data science practitioner to decide how you go about your EDA, including selecting appropriate statistical metrics to be calculated + which types of exploratory graphics to make use of.
