 	Assignment: Cross Validating a Linear Regression Model
 		This notebook explores data from the UC Irvine machine learning archive to gain some familiarity with the dataset, and get a general sense of what features are available. Then, it constructs a pair of cross-validated linear regression models that predict the weight of a vehicle. The cross-validated performance of the two models is then compared to identify the preferred model, and concluding thoughts added.

		The EDA was poorly done, but has a good example of machine learning with R^2 metrics derived from the K-fold cross validation of a linear regression model
